# 4.	Howie earns a profit of $350 on each Aqua-Spa (X1) he sells and $300
# on each Hydro-Lux (X2) he sells. Only 200 pumps are available and each
# hot tub requires one pump. He has only 1,566 labor hours available during
# the next production cycle. Each Aqua-Spa he builds (each unit of X1) 
# requires 9 labor hours and each Hydro-Lux (each unit of X2) requires 6 
# labor hours. Each Aqua-Spa requires 12 feet of tubing, and each Hydro-Lux
# produced requires 16 feet of tubing. Total tubing available is 2,880 feet.
# 
# Howieâ€™s objective is to maximize the profit. How many Aqua-Spas and 
# Hydro-Luxes should be produced? Hidden constraints:  There are simple
# lower bounds of zero on the variables X1 and X2 because it is impossible
# to produce a negative number of hot tubs.
